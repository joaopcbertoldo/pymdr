# Installation

The `setup.py` has not been tested yet and is not safe to use. Please follow the instructions bellow.

Python Version 3.6.9

## Instructions

- Clone or download this repo.

- Open a terminal **in the root directory** of the project.

- Make sure you are using the right python version is 3.6.9.

```bash
python3 -V
```

- Make sure you have `virtualenv` installed.

```bash
pip install virtualenv==20.0.18
```

- Create a virtual environment and install the requirements (replace `apt` if you are not on ubuntu).

```bash
virtualenv venv -p python3.6
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requrirements/dev.txt
```

- Install `graphviz`.

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
```

- Add the src module to the PYTHONPATH in the virtualenv.

```bash
PTH_FILE="$(pwd)/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/src.pth"
touch PTH_FILE
echo "$(pwd)/src" >> PTH_FILE
deactivate
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

## To use it in the browser 

The only tested browser is Google Chrome Version 81.0.4044.92 (Official Build) (64-bit).

Start the API: 

```bash
# with the terminal open in the root of the project...
./launch-api.sh
```

Install the extension on Chrome using the developer mode. See instructions on how to do this at the beginning (2nd step) of [this tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).

- cleanup the nbs
- make outputs results available somehow
- write a good readme.md
